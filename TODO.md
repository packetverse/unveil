# Todo

- [ ] Add custom providers/blacklists option for `check` command
- [ ] Separate commands in different files to make code more readable
- [ ] Add option to check if a blacklist/provider is online and working
- [ ] Add support for multiple output formats
- [ ] Add threading to allow for faster scans

# In progress

- [ ] Add some more output and logs and verbose messages currently only a couple
- [ ] Add logging and handle it correctly and well for debugging and other purposes because it's currently fucking shit
- [ ] Add metavar parameters to some of the `typer.Argument`
- [ ] Add docstrings instead of using the help parameter for everything

# Done

- [x] Add more sources to fetch from automatically for `ip` command since it only currently has 2 different API calls
