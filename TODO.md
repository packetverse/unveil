- [ ] Separate commands in different files to make code more readable
- [ ] Add option to check if a blacklist/provider is online and working
- [ ] Add support for multiple output formats

# In progress

- [ ] Add logging and handle it correctly and well for debugging and other purposes because it's currently fucking shit
