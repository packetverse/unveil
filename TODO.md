# Todo

- [ ] Add custom providers/blacklists option for `check` command
- [ ] Separate commands in different files to make code more readable
- [ ] Add option to check if a blacklist/provider is online and working
- [ ] Add support for multiple output formats
- [ ] Add more sources to fetch from automatically for `ip` command since it only currently has 2 different API calls
